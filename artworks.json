      "description": "The work represents an important milestone for Caravaggio.[1] He painted it when he was attempting an independent career after leaving the workshop of the Cavaliere Giuseppe Cesari d'Arpino, for whom he had been painting 'flowers and fruit', finishing the details for the Cavaliere's mass-produced (and massive) output. Caravaggio left Arpino's workshop in January 1594 and began selling works through the dealer Costantino, with the assistance of Prospero Orsi, an established painter of Mannerist grotesques (masks, monsters, etc.). Orsi introduced Caravaggio to his extensive network of contacts in the world of collectors and patrons.",

      "description": "Caravaggio's 'Calling of Saint Matthew' captures a powerful moment of spiritual awakening. Set in a gritty, realistic environment, Christ points to Matthew, a tax collector, inviting him to follow. The painting highlights the divine entering everyday life, emphasizing the transformative power of faith and making spirituality accessible to all.",
